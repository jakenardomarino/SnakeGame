Snake Game (Java Swing)
Overview

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java using Swing for the GUI.
The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats apples to grow longer, and must avoid colliding with the walls or itself. The game keeps track of the score based on the number of apples eaten.

This project demonstrates basic game development concepts in Java, including:

GUI creation with Swing and AWT

Event handling and keyboard input

Game loops using Timer

Collision detection
